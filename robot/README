Arduino is used to control motors

And I use raspberry pi to program the robot using python.

In self_control.py, you can pre-program how the robot moves.

And in ps_controller.py, you can use ps3 controller to control how the robot moves.

In the future, I will add the image processing module to it. So the robot can move according the input from what it sees.
